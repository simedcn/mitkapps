Getting Started
---------------

This is a *template*. You must modify it such that it fits the needs of your particular project.

Especially you should do a global search and replace for the string "awesome" to rename the template application and plug-in. You may want to rename some files too.

You can download a [tarball](https://github.com/MITK/MITK-ProjectTemplate/tarball/master) or [zipball](https://github.com/MITK/MITK-ProjectTemplate/zipball/master) which contains the current sources. You should only clone this repository (or fork it on Github) if you want to work with the project template itself (i.e. by contributing improvements).

Please read the [Developer Tutorial](http://mitk.org/wiki/Developer_Tutorial) for build instructions.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

- Linux (e.g. Ubuntu 14.04)
- Windows 7 or newer with Visual Studio 2013 Update 5
- macOS 10.9 or newer

Requirements
------------

- CMake 3.5 or newer
- Qt 5.6 or Qt 5.7.1
